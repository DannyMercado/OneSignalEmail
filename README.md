Unity Project that implements OneSignal's setEmail and setExternalUserId methods. This includes the assets folder, which includes the OneSignalControl.cs file. It also has the runnable apk build for android devices.

I was not able to set the external ID for the email channel in the OneSignal Dashboard.

In an android project, I was able to set the external ID for email with near identical code.
